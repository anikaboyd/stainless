# Documentation Update: API Authentication Guide

This documentation addition enhances the Stainless Guides section by introducing clear, concise, and opinionated content about API Authentication methods. It's intended to educate developersâ€”both new and experiencedâ€”on fundamental API security concepts.

## Location in Docs

To seamlessly match the current Stainless documentation structure, this new page will sit under the **Guides** section as follows:

```
Guides
â”œâ”€â”€ Automate OpenAPI updates
â”œâ”€â”€ Integrate with docs frameworks
â”œâ”€â”€ API Authentication (ðŸ†• My new page)
â”œâ”€â”€ Patch with custom code
â””â”€â”€ Create an OpenAPI spec

```

**Page Title:** API Authentication  
**Slug:** `/guides/api-authentication`

## Crosslink Strategy

To enhance discoverability and user experience, two crosslinks are included:

### 1. From Existing SDK Authentication Page â†’ My New Guide:

-   **Where:** At the bottom of the SDK Authentication configuration page, in a "Whatâ€™s Next?" section.
    
-   **Suggested Verbiage:**
    
    > "Need a primer on the different types of API authentication? Check out our [API Authentication guide](https://app.stainless.com/docs/guides/api-authentication)."
    
-   **Reasoning:** Provides conceptual support for users looking to understand authentication before diving into implementation specifics.
    

### 2. From My API Authentication Guide â†’ SDK Authentication Page:

-   **Where:** At the bottom of my new guide, in a "Whatâ€™s Next?" section.
    
-   **Suggested Verbiage:**
    
    > "Once you've chosen an authentication method, head to the [Authentication in SDK config](https://app.stainless.com/docs/guides/configure#authentication) to learn how to implement it with Stainless."
    
-   **Reasoning:** Helps users transition from theory and planning directly into practical implementation within the Stainless framework.

## Visual Assets

I've decided to include visuals for clearer communication and easier understanding. Visual examples help readers quickly grasp concepts and implementation details.
